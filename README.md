# Winder
Column-based file system viewer for Windows (like Mac OS Finder)

## Motivation
After switching to Windows I realized I missed the broad perspective that Finder's column view gave when exploring the file system. I fruitlessly combed the Internet for a Windows alternative but the few that I found were quite shoddy, so I decided to build my own.

Also, I wanted to learn more about Windows apps and WPF.

## Status

On Dec 31, 2022, I decided to stop working on this project (though I had been dormant for 3 years prior) because I think I have graduated to cloud and web based tech. But this was an awesome educational project and I would recommend others to embark on things like this.
