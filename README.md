# Winder
Column-based file system viewer for Windows (like Mac OS Finder)

## Motivation
After switching to Windows I realized I missed the broad perspective that Finder's column view gave when exploring the file system. I fruitlessly combed the Internet for a Windows alternative but the few that I found were quite shoddy, so I decided to build my own.
